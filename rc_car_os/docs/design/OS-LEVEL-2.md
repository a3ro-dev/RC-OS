# RC Car Operating System - Level 2

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Level 2 capabilities of the RC Car Operating System. At this level, the system extends the functionalities of [Level 1](#file:OS-LEVEL-1.md-context) by introducing steering capabilities.

## Drive Type

Just like in Level 1, the system supports rear-wheel drive. The power from the engine is directed solely to the rear wheels. This type of drive is prevalent in many vehicles due to its simplicity and effectiveness in various conditions. The driving motor is located at the rear.

## Steering

In contrast to Level 1, Level 2 introduces steering functionality. The RC car is now capable of left-right movement, enhancing its maneuverability significantly. This is made possible by the inclusion of a steering motor located at the front. However, the steering type supported at this level only allows for left-right movement.

## Motion

The system continues to support forward and backward motion, similar to Level 1. This means that the RC car can move in a straight line either forward or backward. The addition of steering functionality at this level means the car can now also change direction while moving.

Please note that these are the functionalities supported at Level 2. Future levels may include more advanced features such as all-wheel drive, more complex motion capabilities, and advanced steering functionalities.
