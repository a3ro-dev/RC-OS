# RC Car Operating System - Level 1

This document provides a detailed description of the Level 1 capabilities of the RC Car Operating System. At this level, the system supports a limited set of functionalities.

## Drive Type

The system supports only rear-wheel drive. This means that the power from the engine is directed to the rear wheels only. This type of drive is common in many vehicles due to its simplicity and effectiveness in various conditions.

## Steering

At Level 1, the system does not support any steering functionality. This means that the RC car can only move in a straight line. The absence of steering functionality limits the maneuverability of the car.

## Motion

The system supports only forward and backward motion. This means that the RC car can move in a straight line either forward or backward. The car cannot move sideways or turn.

Please note that these are the basic functionalities supported at Level 1. Future levels may include more advanced features such as steering, all-wheel drive, and more complex motion capabilities.
